"To assist monitoring immediate risk of alcohol-related injury, as defined by Guideline 2 of the 2009 National Health and Medical Research Council Guidelines, this indicator provides information on the proportion of adults who consumed more than 4 standard drinks on a single occasion in the last four weeks (see Methods tab for further information).",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"The indicator shows self-reported data collected through Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI). Estimates were weighted to adjust for differences in the probability of selection among respondents and were benchmarked to the estimated residential population using the latest available Australian Bureau of Statistics mid-year population estimates. Adults are defined as persons aged 16 years and over in the NSW Population Health Survey. In order to address diminishing coverage of the population by landline telephone numbers (&lt;85% since 2010), a mobile phone number sampling frame was introduced into the 2012 survey. ",,,,,,
