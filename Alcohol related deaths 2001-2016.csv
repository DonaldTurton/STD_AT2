"Excludes conditions where low to moderate alcohol consumption has an apparent overall protective effect. Calculated using age and sex-specific aetiological fractions from the&nbsp;Australian Burden of Disease Study 2011: methods and supplementary information. Only NSW residents are included. Deaths were classified using ICD-10. Rates were age-adjusted using the Australian population as at 30 June 2001. Counts of deaths for the latest years of data include an estimate of the number of deaths occurring in that year but registered in the next year. Data on late registrations were unavailable at the time of production. LL/UL 95%CI = lower and upper limits of the 95% confidence interval for the point estimate. Data for some Local Health Districts (LHDs) may not be included individually due to low numbers. All LHDs includes these LHDs where numbers are low, and records where the LHD was missing or not stated. Albury Local Government Area (LGA) is included in All LHDs. ",,,,,,
