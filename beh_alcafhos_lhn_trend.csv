"Calculated using age and sex-specific aetiological fractions from the&nbsp;Australian Burden of Disease Study 2011: methods and supplementary information. Only NSW residents are included. Figures are based on where a person resides, not where they are treated. Hospital separations were classified using ICD-10-AM. Rates were age-adjusted using the Australian population as at 30 June 2001. Numbers for recent years include an estimate of the small number of hospitalisations of NSW residents in interstate public hospitals, data for which were unavailable at the time of production. Further details can be found in the Methods tab &nbsp;in the following HealthStats NSW indicator: http://www.healthstats.nsw.gov.au/Indicator/bod_hos_cat Data for some LHDs may not be included individually due to low numbers. All LHDs include Albury Local Government Area and those LHDs where numbers are low and records where the LHD was missing or not stated. ",,,,,,,
